# ClimateAnalysisModel

Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts daily mean air temperatures based on inputs such as geographical location, year, and time of year. Using the Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD), the model will analyze historical trends and output future temperature predictions. This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the project workflow, with special emphasis on the dataset structure, model design, and training process.

Dataset Description

The AHCCD dataset is specifically curated for climate research, containing long-term daily temperature records that are adjusted to remove non-climatic factors. The data structure allows precise modeling of temporal and spatial patterns in temperature. Below are the key elements:

Dataset Features

Geographic Variables:

lon (Longitude): Represents the east-west position of the station.

lat (Latitude): Represents the north-south position of the station.

elev (Elevation): Indicates station height, which impacts temperature variations.

prov (Province): Identifies the station’s regional location.

Temporal Variables:

time: Daily timestamps for recorded temperatures.

tas, tasmax, tasmin: Daily mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius.

tas_flag, tasmax_flag, tasmin_flag: Flags indicating data quality (e.g., missing, estimated, or adjusted).

Metadata:

station: Station identification number.

station_name: Name of the station.

Why This Dataset Is Suitable

Granular Temporal Resolution: Daily records allow fine-grained temporal analysis and predictions for specific days of the year.

Spatial Coverage: Geographic variables like latitude, longitude, and elevation enable predictions tailored to specific locations.

Homogenized Data: Adjustments ensure that observed trends are purely climatic and not influenced by changes in station instrumentation or location.

Flagged Data: Provides insight into data quality, allowing better handling of uncertainties.

Project Workflow

The project workflow can be broken into distinct phases:

1. Data Preparation

Cleaning:

Remove rows with missing or unreliable temperature data based on flags (tas_flag, etc.).

Impute missing values where necessary using statistical methods like interpolation.

Feature Engineering:

Encode categorical variables (e.g., prov) using one-hot encoding.

Standardize numeric features (e.g., tas, elev, lon, lat) to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Extract additional time-based features like day_of_year and year from the time variable.

Dataset Splitting:

Divide the data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets, ensuring temporal and spatial consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Use visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to:

Plot temperature trends over time.

Analyze spatial distributions of temperatures.

Examine correlations between temperature and variables like elevation and latitude.

3. Model Development

Model Objective: Predict daily mean temperature (tas) based on location, year, and time of year.

Inputs:

lon, lat, elev: Represent location.

day_of_year, year: Represent temporal features.

Encoded prov values.

Output:

Predicted daily mean temperature (tas).

Model Type:

A Neural Network (NN) is chosen for its ability to model nonlinear relationships between input features and outputs.

Model Architecture

Input Layer:

Accepts standardized numerical inputs (e.g., latitude, longitude, elevation) and one-hot encoded categorical inputs (e.g., province).

Hidden Layers:

Fully connected (Dense) layers with ReLU activation functions to capture nonlinear interactions between features.

Dropout layers for regularization to prevent overfitting.

Output Layer:

A single neuron with a linear activation function to predict the continuous temperature value.

Example architecture:

Input Layer: 8 neurons (number of input features).

Hidden Layer 1: 64 neurons, ReLU activation.

Hidden Layer 2: 32 neurons, ReLU activation.

Dropout: 20%.

Output Layer: 1 neuron, linear activation.

4. Model Training

Training Configuration:

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to minimize the difference between predicted and actual temperatures.

Optimizer: Adam optimizer for adaptive learning rates.

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average prediction error in degrees Celsius.

R² Score: Assesses how well the model captures variance in the data.

Training Process:

Batching:

Divide the training data into smaller batches for efficient computation.

Epochs:

Train the model for a specified number of iterations (e.g., 100 epochs), monitoring validation loss to prevent overfitting.

Validation:

Use a validation set to tune hyperparameters and assess generalization.

Checkpointing:

Save the model at the epoch with the best validation performance.

Evaluation and Prediction

1. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on the test set using metrics such as:

MSE and MAE to measure prediction accuracy.

R² to understand how well the model explains variability in the data.

2. Prediction:

Input future year, location, and day of the year into the trained model.

Output daily mean temperature predictions for those inputs.

3. Visualization:

Plot predicted vs. actual temperatures to assess accuracy.

Generate spatial and temporal heatmaps of predicted temperatures for specific years and regions.

Scalability and Future Enhancements

Incorporate External Data:

Add external datasets (e.g., global climate indices like ENSO) to improve predictions.

Enhance Model Complexity:

Experiment with advanced architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial features.

Use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential temporal features.

Adapt to Climate Change:

Incorporate climate models or projections to account for accelerating changes in climate patterns.

This detailed workflow ensures a systematic approach to developing a robust predictive model using the AHCCD dataset, offering actionable insights into Canada’s future climate.
